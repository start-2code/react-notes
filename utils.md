The line `import get from 'lodash/get';` imports the `get` function from the Lodash library, which is a popular utility library in JavaScript. The `get` function is particularly useful for safely accessing deeply nested properties in objects without having to write a lot of boilerplate code to check if each level of the object exists.

### Explanation of `lodash.get`

1. **Purpose**:
   - The `get` function from Lodash allows you to access the value of a nested property within an object. It provides a safe way to access properties without throwing an error if a property in the chain is `undefined` or `null`.

2. **Usage**:
   - `get` takes three parameters:
     1. **`object`**: The object to query.
     2. **`path`**: The path of the property to get, which can be a string or an array of strings representing the path to the desired property.
     3. **`defaultValue`** (optional): The value returned if the resolved value is `undefined`.

3. **Syntax**:
   ```javascript
   const value = get(object, path, [defaultValue]);
   ```

4. **Example Usage**:

   Consider an example where you have a deeply nested object:

   ```javascript
   const user = {
     id: 1,
     name: 'John Doe',
     address: {
       city: 'New York',
       zip: '10001',
       geo: {
         lat: '40.7128',
         lng: '-74.0060',
       },
     },
   };
   ```

   - **Accessing Nested Properties Using `get`**:
     ```javascript
     import get from 'lodash/get';

     // Safe access to a deeply nested property
     const latitude = get(user, 'address.geo.lat', 'No Latitude Available');
     console.log(latitude); // Output: '40.7128'

     // Accessing a non-existing property with a default value
     const state = get(user, 'address.state', 'No State Available');
     console.log(state); // Output: 'No State Available'
     ```

   - **Without `get`**:
     - You would need to check each level to avoid errors if a property is `undefined`:
       ```javascript
       const latitude = user && user.address && user.address.geo && user.address.geo.lat;
       ```

5. **Key Benefits of Using `lodash.get`**:
   - **Avoid Errors**: Prevents "Cannot read property 'x' of undefined" errors by safely navigating through the object.
   - **Readability**: Improves code readability by removing the need for multiple nested checks.
   - **Default Values**: Allows specifying a default value that will be returned if the resolved value is `undefined`.

### Summary

- **`lodash.get`** is a utility function that provides a safe and convenient way to access deeply nested properties in an object.
- It enhances code readability and robustness by preventing runtime errors when trying to access properties that may not exist.
- Using `lodash.get` is a common practice in JavaScript and TypeScript applications where deeply nested object structures are involved, such as in data manipulation, form handling, or API response processing.
